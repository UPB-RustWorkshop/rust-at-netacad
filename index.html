# Old kids on the block

- C was developed __50 years__ ago
- C++ was developed __39 years__ ago
- is ok when only geeks use computers

Why now?
- C and C++ were the only languages used for OS
- C/C++ allow you to do anything
- few people write code in C, most of them use C++, C#, Java and others
  - unless you write drivers or embedded software
  - C++ is another funny story, what about [Go](https://golang.org/)?

We have new tools available
- now we have languages like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

---
# New kids on the block

This is what we would most probably use

- Math - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Low level - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Services (web servers ...) - [Go](https://golang.org/) / [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Applications
  - enterprise - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
  - web applications - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - mobile - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) / [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)

- Rocket Science (we assume you work for NASA) - [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- Electrical Engineering - [LabView](https://www.ni.com/ro-ro/shop/labview.html)
- Scripting - [Deno](https://deno.land/)

---
# What is new in these languages?

- most of them **they are safe!** (well ... not Zig)
- build systems (`cargo`)
- package management (`cargo`) and a package repository (`crates.io`)
- have a rich standard library
- testing framework

What is missing?

**incremental replacement** for C++

---
# Let's start small

- C drop-in replacement
- no hidden code path, what you write is what you get
- has a `defer` statement
- compile-time execution
- types are constants
- supports cross-compiling easily
- provides an allocator

Meet Zero, Zig's mascot

.right_img[.right[![zero](images/zero.svg)]]

---
## C Drop-In replacement

No need to rewrite everything in C, we can just replace it file by file

```zig
const c = @cImport({
    // See https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/515
    @cDefine("_NO_CRT_STDIO_INLINE", "1");
    @cInclude("stdio.h");
});
pub fn main() void {
    _ = c.printf("hello\n");
}
```

---
## Compile-Time execution

*An interesting way of allowing templates*

```zig
fn max(comptime T: type, a: T, b: T) T {
    if (T == bool) {
        return a or b;
    } else if (a > b) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return b;
    }
}

max(u32, 10, 20);
```

---
## Types are constants

Data types and be passed around and be used as constants (`comptime` variables)

```zig
const Point = struct {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
};
```

---
## Testing framework

```zig
const std = @import("std");

fn addOne(number: i32) i32 {
    return number + 1;
}

test "expect addOne adds one to 41" {
    try std.testing.expect(addOne(41) == 42);
}

test addOne {
    // A test name can also be written using an identifier.
    // This is a doctest, and serves as documentation for `addOne`.
    try std.testing.expect(addOne(41) == 42);
}
```

Run the tests

```bash
zig test
```

---
## Defer a call

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const expect = std.testing.expect;
const print = std.debug.print;

fn deferExample() !usize {
    var a: usize = 1;

    {
        defer a = 2;
        a = 1;
    }
    try expect(a == 2);

    a = 5;
    return a;
}
```

```zig
test "defer basics" {
    try expect((try deferExample()) == 5);
}
```

---
## Allocator

Provided allocators:
- `std.heap.c_allocator` - libc
- `std.heap.ThreadSafeAllocator`
- `std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator` - you know at compile time4 how much memory you will use
- `std.heap.ArenaAllocator` - free all at once
- `std.heap.ArenaAllocator` - always fails
- `std.testing.allocator`

```zig
const std = @import("std");

test "detect leak" {
    var list = std.ArrayList(u21).init(std.testing.allocator);
    // missing `defer list.deinit();`
    try list.append('â˜”');

    try std.testing.expect(list.items.len == 1);
}
```

# Primitive Types 

.column[
- `unit`: () (similar with `void` from C)
- `bool`: `true` and `false`
- `char`: `'c'` or `'ðŸ˜º'` (`char`s are Unicode code-points, i.e. 4 bytes long!)

- Numerics: specify the signedness and size.
    - `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize`
    - `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize`
    - `f32`, `f64`
    - `isize` & `usize` are the size of pointers (and therefore have
        machine-dependent size)
    - Literals are spelled like `10i8`, `10u16`, `10.0f32`, `10usize`.
    - Type inference for non-specific literals default to `i32` or `f64`:
      - e.g. `10` defaults to `i32`, `10.0` defaults to `f64`.

# Ownership

- A variable binding _takes ownership_ of its data.
    - A piece of data can only have one owner at a time.
- When a binding goes out of scope, the bound data is released automatically. (`Drop` trait)
    - For heap-allocated data, this means de-allocation.
- Data _must be guaranteed_ to outlive its references.

```rust
fn foo() {
    // Creates a String
    // Gives ownership of the String object to s
    let s = String::from ("This text is owned by s");

    // At the end of the scope, s goes out of scope.
    // s still owns the String object, so it can be cleaned up.
}
```

---

## Move Semantics

```rust
let s1 = String::from ("A string");

// Ownership of the String object moves to s2.
let s2 = s1;

println!("{}", s1); // error: use of moved value `s1`
```

- `let s2 = s1;`
    - We don't want to copy the data, since that's expensive.
    - The data cannot have multiple owners.
    - Solution: move the String's ownership into `s2`, and declare `s1` invalid.
- `println!("{}", s1);`
    - We know that `s1` is no longer a valid variable binding, so this is an error.
- Rust can reason about this at compile time, so it throws a compiler error.

---
## Ownership

- Ownership does not always have to be moved.
- What would happen if it did? Rust would get very tedious to write:

```rust
fn string_length(s: String) -> String {
    // Do whatever here,
    // then return ownership of `s` back to the caller
}
```
- You could imagine that this does not scale well either.
    - The more variables you had to hand back, the longer your return type would be!
    - Imagine having to pass ownership around for 5+ variables at a time :(

```rust
fn string_length(s1: String, s2: String, ...) -> (String, String, ...) {
    // Do whatever here,
    // then return ownership of `s1`, `s2`, ... back to the caller
}
```
---
## Borrowing

- Instead of transferring ownership, we can _borrow_ data.
- A variable's data can be borrowed by taking a reference to the variable;
  ownership doesn't change.
    - When a reference goes out of scope, the borrow is over.
    - The original variable retains ownership throughout.

```rust
let s = String::from ("string");

// s_ref is a reference to s.
let s_ref = &s;

// use s_ref to access the data in the String s.
assert_eq!(s.chars().nth(1), s_ref.chars().nth(1));
```

Rust does automatic dereferencing.

---
## Borrowing

- Caveat: this adds restrictions to the original variable.
- Ownership cannot be transferred from a variable while references to it exist.
    - That would invalidate the reference.

```rust
let s = String::from("for borrow");

// s_ref is a reference to s.
let s_ref = &s;

// Moving ownership to s_new would invalidate s_ref.
// error: cannot move out of `s` because it is borrowed
let s_new = s;

println! ("{}", s_ref);
```

Try it without the `println!`

---
## Borrowing

```rust
/// `length` only needs `String` temporarily, so it is borrowed.
fn length(str_ref: &String) -> usize {
    // vec_ref is auto-dereferenced when you call methods on it.
    str_ref.len()
    // you can also explicitly dereference.
    // (*str_ref).len()
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::new ();
    length(&s);
    println!("{:?}", s); // this is fine
}
```
- Note the type of `length`: `str_ref` is passed by reference, so it's now an `&String`.
- References, like bindings, are *immutable* by default.
- The borrow is over after the reference goes out of scope (at the end of `length`).

---
## Borrowing

```rust
/// `push` needs to modify `string` so it is borrowed mutably.
fn push(str_ref: &mut String, x: &str) {
    str_ref.push_str (x);
}

fn main() {
    let mut s: String = String::from ("");
    let string_ref: &mut String = &mut s;
    push(string_ref, "str");
    assert_eq!(string_ref, "str");
}
```
- Variables can be borrowed by _mutable_ reference: `&mut string_ref`.
    - `string_ref` is a reference to a mutable `String`.
    - The type is `&mut String`, not `&String`.
- Different from a reference which is variable.

---
## `Copy` Types

- Rust defines a trait&sup1; named `Copy` that signifies that a type may be
    copied instead whenever it would be moved.
- Most primitive types are `Copy` (`i32`, `f64`, `char`, `bool`, etc.)
- Types that contain references may not be `Copy` (e.g. `Vec`, `String`).
```rust
let x: i32 = 12;
let y = x; // `i32` is `Copy`, so it's not moved :D
println!("x still works: {}, and so does y: {}", x, y);
```

&sup1; Like a Java/Go interface or Haskell typeclass


---
## Borrowing Rules
##### _The Holy Grail of Rust_
Learn these rules, and they will serve you well.

- You can't keep borrowing something after it stops existing.
- One object may have many immutable references to it (`&T`).
- **OR** _exactly one_ mutable reference (`&mut T`) (not both).
- That's it!

.card[.small[.center[![Borrow Rules](images/sep_borrow_rules.png)]]]

---
### Borrowing Prevents...

- Use-after-free
- Valid in C, C++...

```rust
let y: &i32;
{
    let x = 5;
    y = &x; // error: `x` does not live long enough
}
println!("{}", *y);
```

- The full error message:

```
error: `x` does not live long enough
note: reference must be valid for the block suffix following statement
    0 at 1:16
...but borrowed value is only valid for the block suffix
    following statement 0 at 4:18
```

- This eliminates a _huge_ number of memory safety bugs _at compile time_.
- As a side note, this technique of creating a block to limit the scope of a
variable (in this case x) is pretty useful.

---
## Methods parameters

- The first argument to a method, named `self`, determines what kind of ownership the method
  requires.
- `&self`: the method *borrows* the value.
    - Use this unless you need a different ownership model.
- `&mut self`: the method *mutably borrows* the value.
    - The function needs to modify the struct it's called on.
- `self`: the method takes ownership.
    - The function consumes the value and may return something else.

---

# `match` 
- `switch` on steroids.

```rust
let x = 3;

match x {
    1 => println!("one fish"),  // <- comma required
    2 => {
        println!("two fish");
        println!("two fish");
    },  // <- comma optional when using braces
    // we can match several patterns in one arm
    3 | 4 => println!("three or four, dunno"),
    _ => println!("no fish for you"), // "otherwise" case
}
```

- `match` takes an expression (`x`) and branches on a list of `value => expression` statements.
- The entire match evaluates to one expression.
    - Like `if`, all arms must evaluate to the same type.
- `_` is commonly used as a catch-all (cf. Haskell, OCaml)

---

## `match` pattern
```rust
let x = 3;
let y = -3;
let q = 10;

let s = match (x, y) {
    (1, 1) => "one".to_string(),
    (2, j) => format!("two, {}", j),
    (_, 3) => "three".to_string(),
    (i, j) if i > 5 && j < 0 => "On guard!".to_string(),
    // NB: note that we do not test x == 10 here!
    (q, k) => format!("???: {} {}", q, k),
};
println!("{}", s);
```

- The matched expression can be any expression (l-value), including tuples and function calls.
    - Matches can bind variables. `_` is a throw-away variable name.
- You _must_ write an exhaustive match in order to compile.
- Use `if`-guards to constrain a match to certain conditions.
- Patterns can get very complex.

---

# Enum

- An enum, or "sum type", is a way to express some data that may be one of several things.
- Similar to the union type in C
- Much more powerful than in Java, C, C++, C#...
- Each enum variant can have optional payloads:
    - no data (unit variant)
    - named data (struct variant)
    - unnamed ordered data (tuple variant)

```rust
enum Resultish {
    Ok,
    Warning { code: i32, message: String },
    Err(String)
}
```

.card[.small[.center[![Enum](images/sep_enum.png)]]]

class: split-70

# `Option` .top_image[![Seatbelt](images/seatbelt.png)] 

- Rust has no NULL type
- a variable of a type has to store a value of that actual type
- a reference has to exist and point to a valid memory

Use `Option` enum

.column[
```rust
enum Option<T> {
  Some(T)
  None,
}
```

T is any valid type
]

.column[
.card[.small_vertical[.center[![Option](images/sep_option.png)]]]
]

---

## `Option` example

Rust automatically imports  `Option::*`

```rust
fn integer_division (a:isize, b: isize) -> Option<isize> {
  if b == 0 {
    None
  } else {
    Some(a / b)
  }
}

fn main () {
  let x = 120;
  let y = 7;
  match integer_division (x, y) {
    Some(d) => println! ("{}:{} = {}", x, y, d),
    None => println! ("division by 0")
  };
}
```

---

# Traits


- Similar to interfaces in Java
- Methods that types have to implement

.column[
```rust
struct Professor {
  firstname: String,
  lastname: String,
  age: usize,
  // add subjects
}

trait Person {
  fn get_name (&self) -> String;
  fn get_job (&self) -> String;
}

impl Person for Professor {
  fn get_name (&self) -> String {
    // ...
  }

  fn get_job (&self) -> String {
    // ...
  }
}
```
]

.column[
.card[.small_vertical[.center[![Struct](images/sep_struct.png)]]]
]

---

## Generics with Trait Bounds

- Multiple trait bounds are specified like `T: Clone + Ord`.
- There's no way (yet) to specify [negative trait bounds](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-mutually-exclusive-traits/2126).
  - e.g. you can't stipulate that a `T` must not be `Clone`.

```rust
fn digital_write<P: Configure + Output>(p: P, value: usize) {
   p.make_output ();
   if value == 1 {
       p.set ();
   } else {
       p.clear ();
   }
}
```

---
## Generic Types With Trait Bounds

- You can also define structs with generic types and trait bounds.
- Be sure to declare all of your generic types in the struct header _and_ the
  impl block header.
- Only the impl block header needs to specify trait bounds.
    - This is useful if you want to have multiple impls for a struct each with
      different trait bounds

```rust
struct MyDriver<P: Pin> {
    pin1: &'static P,
    pin2: &'static P,
    // ...
}
```

And without trait bounds

```rust
struct MyDriver<P> {
    pin1: &'static P,
    pin2: &'static P,
    // ...
}
```

---
## Generic Types With Trait Bounds

```rust
impl<P: Pin> Driver for MyDriver<P> {
   // ...
}
```

---
## Inheritance (kinda)

- Some traits may require other traits to be implemented first.
    - e.g., `Eq` requires that `PartialEq` be implemented, and `Copy` requires `Clone`.
- Implementing the `Child` trait below requires you to also implement `Parent`.

```rust
trait Parent {
    fn foo(&self) {
        // ...
    }
}

trait Child: Parent {
    fn bar(&self) {
        self.foo();
        // ...
    }
}
```

---
### Lifetime annotations

From a birds eye view, how should Rust free `s` and `wfw`?

```rust
fn without_first_word<'a> (s: &'a str) -> &'a str;

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("ana has apples"); 
    let wfw = without_first_word (&s);      
    // drop (s);
    println! ("{}", wfw);                  
    // drop (wfw);
}                                         
```


---
### This is why lifetimes are useful.

```rust
fn without_first_word<'a> (s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    let mut pos = 0;
    for a in s.chars() {
        if a != ' ' { pos = pos + 1; }
        else { break; }
    }
    &s[pos..]
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("ana has apples");
    let wfw = without_first_word (&s);
    // drop (s);

### Efective Lifetimes 

```rust
fn without_first_word<'a> (s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    let mut pos = 0;
    for a in s.chars() {
        if a != ' ' { pos = pos + 1; }
        else { break; }
    }
    &s[pos..]
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("ana has apples"); // <--- s lifetime ('ls) starts here
    let wfw = without_first_word (&s);      // <--- wfw lifetime ('lwfw) starts here
    // drop (s)                             // <--- s lifetime ('ls) ends here, wfw lifetime ('wfw) ends here (due to 'ls)
                                            //      t lifetime ('ts) starts here
    println! ("{}", wfw);                   // <--- wfw lifetime ('lwfw) actually ends here
}                                           // <--- t lifetime ('ts) ends here
```

### Lifetime annotations

```rust
fn without_first_word<'a> (s: &'a str) -> &'a str;

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("ana has apples"); // <--- s lifetime ('ls) starts here
    let wfw = without_first_word (&s);      // <--- wfw lifetime ('lwfw) starts here
    // drop (s)                             // <--- s lifetime ('ls) ends here, wfw lifetime ('wfw) ends here (due to 'ls)
                                            //      t lifetime ('ts) starts here
    println! ("{}", wfw);                   // <--- wfw lifetime ('lwfw) actually ends here
}                                           // <--- t lifetime ('ts) ends here

### Question .top_image[![Questions](images/question.svg)]

Can we use free for `s1` and `s2` before `printf`?

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char * smaller (char *s1, char *s2);

int main () {
    char *s1 = strdup ("ip");
    char *s2 = strdup ("workshop");
    char *small = smaller (s1, s2);
    // free (s1);
    // free (s2);
    printf ("%s\n", small);
}

```

### Multiple Lifetime Parameters

```c
// program: wolverine-mallard-gull
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char * smaller (char *s1, char *s2) {
    if (strlen(s1) > strlen(s2)) return s2;
    else return s1;
}

int main () {
    char *s1 = strdup ("ip");
    char *s2 = strdup ("workshop");
    char *small = smaller (s1, s2);
    // free (s1);
    // free (s2);
    printf ("%s\n", small);
}

```

---
### Multiple Lifetime Parameters

```rust
fn smaller <'a> (s1: &'a str, s2: &'a str) -> &'a str {}

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("ip"); 
    let s2 = String::from("workshop"); 
    let small = smaller (&s1, &s2);
    // drop (s1)
    // drop (s2)
    println! ("{}", small);                  
}                                          
```

---
### Question .top_image[![Questions](images/question.svg)]

Why can't we free s2?

```rust
fn append <'a> (s: &'a mut String, n: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    s.push_str (n);
    s
}

fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::from("ip"); 
    let s2 = String::from(" workshop"); 
    let title = append (&mut s1, &s2);
    // let t1 = s1; // equivalent of free (s1)
    let t2 = s2; // equivalent of free (s2)
    println! ("{}", title);                  
}                                          
```
---
### Multiple Lifetime Parameters

We now can free s2. 

```rust
fn append <'a, 'b> (s: &'a mut String, n: &'b str) -> &'a str {
    s.push_str (n);
    s
}

fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::from("ip"); 
    let s2 = String::from(" workshop"); 
    let title = append (&mut s1, &s2);
    // drop (s1)
    drop (s2)
    println! ("{}", title);                  
}                                          
```

# What is written in Rust?

A lot of software in many domains!

- `Deno` - the *New Node* Javascript engine
- `sudo-rs` which Ubuntu will start using
- `coreutils` - which includes native Windows now
- `windows-rs` - win32 in Rust
- `probe-rs` - embedded debugger
- `helix` - simpler then nvim
- `Zed` - editor
- the new `binder` - Android's core Inter-Process Communication
