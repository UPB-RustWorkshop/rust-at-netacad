# Items to talk

An introduction to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) things.

- Ownership and Borrows
- Enums with payload
- No NULL references
- Traits
- Lifetime annotations

---

# Ownership

- A variable binding _takes ownership_ of its data.
    - A piece of data can only have one owner at a time.
- When a binding goes out of scope, the bound data is released automatically. (`Drop` trait)
    - For heap-allocated data, this means de-allocation.
- Data _must be guaranteed_ to outlive its references.

```rust
fn foo() {
    // Creates a String
    // Gives ownership of the String object to s
    let s = String::from ("This text is owned by s");

    // At the end of the scope, s goes out of scope.
    // s still owns the String object, so it can be cleaned up.
}
```

---
## Ownership

So here are the basics.
- When you introduce a variable binding, it takes ownership of its data. And a
  piece of data can only have one owner at a time.
- When a variable binding goes out of scope, nothing has access to the data
  anymore, so it can be released. Which means, if it's on the heap, it can be
  de-allocated.
- And data must be guaranteed to outlive its references. Or, all references are
  guaranteed to be valid.

---
## Move Semantics

```rust
let s1 = String::from ("A string");

// Ownership of the String object moves to s2.
let s2 = s1;

println!("{}", s1); // error: use of moved value `s1`
```

- `let s2 = s1;`
    - We don't want to copy the data, since that's expensive.
    - The data cannot have multiple owners.
    - Solution: move the String's ownership into `s2`, and declare `s1` invalid.
- `println!("{}", s1);`
    - We know that `s1` is no longer a valid variable binding, so this is an error.
- Rust can reason about this at compile time, so it throws a compiler error.

---
## Move Semantics

- Moving ownership copies data. BUT:
    - Often moves are optimized out by compiler.
    - When we move ownership of a heap allocated data (e.g. `String`), we do
        not touch data on heap, just few bytes allocated on stack are copied
        (pointer to heap, length and capacity; 24 bytes on 64-bit machine)
- Moves are automatic (via assignments); no need to use something like C++'s
  `std::move`.
    - However, there are functions like `std::mem::replace` in Rust to provide
      advanced ownership management.
- For more finer-grained control see standrard library functions:
`std::mem::replace`, `std::mem::swap` and others.

---
## Ownership

- Ownership does not always have to be moved.
- What would happen if it did? Rust would get very tedious to write:

```rust
fn string_length(s: String) -> String {
    // Do whatever here,
    // then return ownership of `s` back to the caller
}
```
- You could imagine that this does not scale well either.
    - The more variables you had to hand back, the longer your return type would be!
    - Imagine having to pass ownership around for 5+ variables at a time :(

```rust
fn string_length(s1: String, s2: String, ...) -> (String, String, ...) {
    // Do whatever here,
    // then return ownership of `s1`, `s2`, ... back to the caller
}
```
---
## Borrowing

- Instead of transferring ownership, we can _borrow_ data.
- A variable's data can be borrowed by taking a reference to the variable;
  ownership doesn't change.
    - When a reference goes out of scope, the borrow is over.
    - The original variable retains ownership throughout.

```rust
let s = String::from ("string");

// s_ref is a reference to s.
let s_ref = &s;

// use s_ref to access the data in the String s.
assert_eq!(s.chars().nth(1), s_ref.chars().nth(1));
```

Rust does automatic dereferencing.

---
## Borrowing

- Caveat: this adds restrictions to the original variable.
- Ownership cannot be transferred from a variable while references to it exist.
    - That would invalidate the reference.

```rust
let s = String::from("for borrow");

// s_ref is a reference to s.
let s_ref = &s;

// Moving ownership to s_new would invalidate s_ref.
// error: cannot move out of `s` because it is borrowed
let s_new = s;

println! ("{}", s_ref);
```

Try it without the `println!`

---
## Borrowing

```rust
/// `length` only needs `String` temporarily, so it is borrowed.
fn length(str_ref: &String) -> usize {
    // vec_ref is auto-dereferenced when you call methods on it.
    str_ref.len()
    // you can also explicitly dereference.
    // (*str_ref).len()
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::new ();
    length(&s);
    println!("{:?}", s); // this is fine
}
```
- Note the type of `length`: `str_ref` is passed by reference, so it's now an `&String`.
- References, like bindings, are *immutable* by default.
- The borrow is over after the reference goes out of scope (at the end of `length`).

---
## Borrowing

```rust
/// `push` needs to modify `string` so it is borrowed mutably.
fn push(str_ref: &mut String, x: &str) {
    str_ref.push_str (x);
}

fn main() {
    let mut s: String = String::from ("");
    let string_ref: &mut String = &mut s;
    push(string_ref, "str");
    assert_eq!(string_ref, "str");
}
```
- Variables can be borrowed by _mutable_ reference: `&mut string_ref`.
    - `string_ref` is a reference to a mutable `String`.
    - The type is `&mut String`, not `&String`.
- Different from a reference which is variable.

---
## Borrowing

```rust
/// `push` needs to modify `string` so it is borrowed mutably.
fn push2(str_ref: &mut String, x: &str) {
    // error: cannot move out of borrowed content.
    let string = *str_ref;
    string.push_str(x);
}

fn main() {
    let mut vector = String::from ("");
    push2(&mut string, "a new str");
}
```
- Error! You can't dereference `string_ref` into a variable binding because that
  would change the ownership of the data.

---
## Borrowing

- Rust will auto-dereference variables...
    - When making method calls on a reference.
    - When passing a reference as a function argument.

```rust
/// `length` only needs `s` temporarily, so it is borrowed.
fn length(s_ref: &&String) -> usize {
    // s_ref is auto-dereferenced when you call methods on it.
    s_ref.len()
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("");
    length(&&&&&&&&&&&&s);
}
```

---
## Borrowing

- You will have to dereference variables...
    - When writing into them.
    - And other times that usage may be ambiguous.

```rust
let mut a = 5;
let ref_a = &mut a;
*ref_a = 4;
println!("{}", *ref_a + 4);
// ==> 8
```

---
## `Copy` Types

- Rust defines a trait&sup1; named `Copy` that signifies that a type may be
    copied instead whenever it would be moved.
- Most primitive types are `Copy` (`i32`, `f64`, `char`, `bool`, etc.)
- Types that contain references may not be `Copy` (e.g. `Vec`, `String`).
```rust
let x: i32 = 12;
let y = x; // `i32` is `Copy`, so it's not moved :D
println!("x still works: {}, and so does y: {}", x, y);
```

&sup1; Like a Java/Go interface or Haskell typeclass


---
## Borrowing Rules
##### _The Holy Grail of Rust_
Learn these rules, and they will serve you well.

- You can't keep borrowing something after it stops existing.
- One object may have many immutable references to it (`&T`).
- **OR** _exactly one_ mutable reference (`&mut T`) (not both).
- That's it!

.card[.small[.center[![Borrow Rules](images/sep_borrow_rules.png)]]]

---
### Borrowing Prevents...

- Iterator invalidation due to mutating a collection you're iterating over.
- This pattern can be written in C, C++, Java, Python, Javascript...
    - But may result in, e.g, `ConcurrentModificationException` (at runtime!)

```rust
let mut vs = [1,2,3,4];
for v in &vs {
    vs[1] = 3;
    println! ("{}", v);
    // ERROR: cannot borrow `vs` as mutable because
    // it is also borrowed as immutable
}
```

- `pop` needs to borrow `vs` as mutable in order to modify the data.
- But `vs` is being borrowed as immutable by the loop!

---
### Borrowing Prevents...

- Use-after-free
- Valid in C, C++...

```rust
let y: &i32;
{
    let x = 5;
    y = &x; // error: `x` does not live long enough
}
println!("{}", *y);
```

- The full error message:

```
error: `x` does not live long enough
note: reference must be valid for the block suffix following statement
    0 at 1:16
...but borrowed value is only valid for the block suffix
    following statement 0 at 4:18
```

- This eliminates a _huge_ number of memory safety bugs _at compile time_.
- As a side note, this technique of creating a block to limit the scope of a
variable (in this case x) is pretty useful.

---
### Borrowing Prevents...

- Data races in multithreaded environments.
- It checks at compile time if it's safe to share or send a given piece of data.
- Compiler ensures that programm uses necessary synchronization using various primitives: mutexes, atomics, channels, etc.
- NB: data races != race condition.
- Check out TRPL section of ["Fearless Concurrency"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-00-concurrency.html)

---
## Methods parameters

- The first argument to a method, named `self`, determines what kind of ownership the method
  requires.
- `&self`: the method *borrows* the value.
    - Use this unless you need a different ownership model.
- `&mut self`: the method *mutably borrows* the value.
    - The function needs to modify the struct it's called on.
- `self`: the method takes ownership.
    - The function consumes the value and may return something else.

---

# `match` 
- `switch` on steroids.

```rust
let x = 3;

match x {
    1 => println!("one fish"),  // <- comma required
    2 => {
        println!("two fish");
        println!("two fish");
    },  // <- comma optional when using braces
    // we can match several patterns in one arm
    3 | 4 => println!("three or four, dunno"),
    _ => println!("no fish for you"), // "otherwise" case
}
```

- `match` takes an expression (`x`) and branches on a list of `value => expression` statements.
- The entire match evaluates to one expression.
    - Like `if`, all arms must evaluate to the same type.
- `_` is commonly used as a catch-all (cf. Haskell, OCaml)

---

## `match` pattern
```rust
let x = 3;
let y = -3;
let q = 10;

let s = match (x, y) {
    (1, 1) => "one".to_string(),
    (2, j) => format!("two, {}", j),
    (_, 3) => "three".to_string(),
    (i, j) if i > 5 && j < 0 => "On guard!".to_string(),
    // NB: note that we do not test x == 10 here!
    (q, k) => format!("???: {} {}", q, k),
};
println!("{}", s);
```

- The matched expression can be any expression (l-value), including tuples and function calls.
    - Matches can bind variables. `_` is a throw-away variable name.
- You _must_ write an exhaustive match in order to compile.
- Use `if`-guards to constrain a match to certain conditions.
- Patterns can get very complex.

---

# Enum

- An enum, or "sum type", is a way to express some data that may be one of several things.
- Similar to the union type in C
- Much more powerful than in Java, C, C++, C#...
- Each enum variant can have optional payloads:
    - no data (unit variant)
    - named data (struct variant)
    - unnamed ordered data (tuple variant)

```rust
enum Resultish {
    Ok,
    Warning { code: i32, message: String },
    Err(String)
}
```

.card[.small[.center[![Enum](../images/sep_enum.png)]]]

---
class: split-70
# Enum `match`-ing

- Enum variants are namespaced by their enum type: `Resultish::Ok`.
    - You can import all variants with `use Resultish::*`.
- Enums, much as you'd expect, can be matched on like any other data type.

.column[
```rust
match make_request() {
    Resultish::Ok =>
        println!("Success!"),
    Resultish::Warning { code, message } =>
        println!("Warning: {}!", message),
    Resultish::Err(s) =>
        println!("Failed with error: {}", s),
}
```
]

# `Option` .top_image[![Seatbelt](../images/seatbelt.png)] 

- Rust has no NULL type
- a variable of a type has to store a value of that actual type
- a reference has to exist and point to a valid memory

Use `Option` enum

.column[
```rust
enum Option<T> {
  Some(T)
  None,
}
```

T is any valid type
]

.column[
.card[.small_vertical[.center[![Option](images/sep_option.png)]]]
]

---

## `Option` example

Rust automatically imports  `Option::*`

```rust
fn integer_division (a:isize, b: isize) -> Option<isize> {
  if b == 0 {
    None
  } else {
    Some(a / b)
  }
}

fn main () {
  let x = 120;
  let y = 7;
  match integer_division (x, y) {
    Some(d) => println! ("{}:{} = {}", x, y, d),
    None => println! ("division by 0")
  };
}
```

---

# Traits


- Similar to interfaces in Java
- Methods that types have to implement

.column[
```rust
struct Professor {
  firstname: String,
  lastname: String,
  age: usize,
  // add subjects
}

trait Person {
  fn get_name (&self) -> String;
  fn get_job (&self) -> String;
}

impl Person for Professor {
  fn get_name (&self) -> String {
    // ...
  }

  fn get_job (&self) -> String {
    // ...
  }
}
```
]

.column[
.card[.small_vertical[.center[![Struct](images/sep_struct.png)]]]
]

---

## Generics with Trait Bounds

- Multiple trait bounds are specified like `T: Clone + Ord`.
- There's no way (yet) to specify [negative trait bounds](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-mutually-exclusive-traits/2126).
  - e.g. you can't stipulate that a `T` must not be `Clone`.

```rust
fn digital_write<P: Configure + Output>(p: P, value: usize) {
   p.make_output ();
   if value == 1 {
       p.set ();
   } else {
       p.clear ();
   }
}
```

---
## Generic Types With Trait Bounds

- You can also define structs with generic types and trait bounds.
- Be sure to declare all of your generic types in the struct header _and_ the
  impl block header.
- Only the impl block header needs to specify trait bounds.
    - This is useful if you want to have multiple impls for a struct each with
      different trait bounds

```rust
struct MyDriver<P: Pin> {
    pin1: &'static P,
    pin2: &'static P,
    // ...
}
```

And without trait bounds

```rust
struct MyDriver<P> {
    pin1: &'static P,
    pin2: &'static P,
    // ...
}
```

---
## Generic Types With Trait Bounds

```rust
impl<P: Pin> Driver for MyDriver<P> {
   // ...
}
```

---
## Inheritance (kinda)

- Some traits may require other traits to be implemented first.
    - e.g., `Eq` requires that `PartialEq` be implemented, and `Copy` requires `Clone`.
- Implementing the `Child` trait below requires you to also implement `Parent`.

```rust
trait Parent {
    fn foo(&self) {
        // ...
    }
}

trait Child: Parent {
    fn bar(&self) {
        self.foo();
        // ...
    }
}
```

# Lifetimes Annotations

- Lifetimes generally have a pretty steep learning curve.
- Don't worry if you don't understand these right away.

```

---
### Lifetime annotations

From a birds eye view, how should Rust free `s` and `wfw`?

```rust
fn without_first_word<'a> (s: &'a str) -> &'a str;

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("ana has apples"); 
    let wfw = without_first_word (&s);      
    // drop (s)
    println! ("{}", wfw);                  
    // drop (s)
}                                         
```


---
### This is why lifetimes are useful.

```rust
fn without_first_word<'a> (s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    let mut pos = 0;
    for a in s.chars() {
        if a != ' ' { pos = pos + 1; }
        else { break; }
    }
    &s[pos..]
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("ana has apples");
    let wfw = without_first_word (&s);
    // drop (s)
    println! ("{}", wfw);
}
```

---
### Efective Lifetimes 

```rust
fn without_first_word<'a> (s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    let mut pos = 0;
    for a in s.chars() {
        if a != ' ' { pos = pos + 1; }
        else { break; }
    }
    &s[pos..]
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("ana has apples"); // <--- s lifetime ('ls) starts here
    let wfw = without_first_word (&s);      // <--- wfw lifetime ('lwfw) starts here
    // drop (s)                             // <--- s lifetime ('ls) ends here, wfw lifetime ('wfw) ends here (due to 'ls)
                                            //      t lifetime ('ts) starts here
    println! ("{}", wfw);                   // <--- wfw lifetime ('lwfw) actually ends here
}                                           // <--- t lifetime ('ts) ends here

fn append <'a, 'b> (s: &'a mut String, n: &'b str) -> &'a str {
    s.push_str (n);
    s
}

fn main() {
    let mut s1 = String::from("ip"); 
    let s2 = String::from(" workshop"); 
    let title = append (&mut s1, &s2);
    // drop (s1)
    drop (s2)
    println! ("{}", title);                  
}                                          
```
